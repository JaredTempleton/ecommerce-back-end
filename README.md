# E-commerce Back End

## Description
This challenge is to build the back end for a e-commerce site. The application uses the Node.js packages, MySQL, Sequilize, express, and dotenv.

	GIVEN a functional Express.js API
	WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
	THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
	WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
	THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
	WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
	THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
	WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
	THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
	WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
	THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
